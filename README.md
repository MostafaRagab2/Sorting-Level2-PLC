# Sorting-Level2-PLC
This project is a PLC-based sorting system where large boxes continue moving forward on a conveyor while small boxes are pushed by a pusher onto another belt. The program is written in Ladder Logic using Siemens TIA Portal and includes a save state feature to allow the system to resume safely after a stop or power loss. Designed for use with Factory I/O or real PLC hardware.
